    <h3>Early Childhood</h3>

    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the greatest footballers in history, had a childhood marked by struggle, determination, and an unwavering passion for football.

Despite the hardships, these early experiences shaped his character and laid the foundation for his remarkable success.</p>

    <p>
        Ronaldo was the youngest of four children in his family. His mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, worked as a cook, while his father, José Dinis Aveiro, was a municipal gardener and part-time kit man for a local football club. The family lived in a small, tin-roofed house, and their modest lifestyle often meant making sacrifices to get by. Yet, even in such circumstances, Ronaldo’s love for football shone through. From a young age, he spent hours playing on the streets of Madeira, kicking improvised balls made of socks or old materials. His early exposure to the sport became a defining part of his life.
