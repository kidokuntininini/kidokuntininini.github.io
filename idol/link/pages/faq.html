        <dt>&#x2764 Is Ronaldo the GOAT ?</dt>
        <dd>Cristiano Ronaldo's journey from a poor family in Madeira to becoming one of football's greatest legends is a testament to hard work, discipline, and resilience. Despite facing doubts, a heart condition at 15, and leaving home at 12, he never gave up. His relentless training, strict diet, and winning mentality keep him at the top, even in his late 30s. Beyond football, he’s generous, giving millions to charity. His story proves that success isn’t given—it’s earned through dedication and perseverance. </dd>
